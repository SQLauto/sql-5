#Project Goals
Create a library of SQL queries that fall into two main areas
*General query templates
*Meta sql for querying the structure of a database server and/or individual database

#Platform
All code is written for SQL server 2008R2 and above

#Sections

##Basic
Individual scripts that retrieve metadata from a SQL Server installation or individual database.  All metadata is stored in temporary tables and the scripts are maintained as independent units of code which limits their level of analysis.  Deeper analysis can be provided via the website interfaces.

##Websites
Sample code for a website that accesses a SQL Server Instance.  The websites provide an interface to access and analyse each database and manage the documentation and visualisations provided by the website.
